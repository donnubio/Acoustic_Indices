# Acoustic_Indices

Acoustic_Indices is a Python library to extract global acoustic indices from an audio file for use as a biodiversity proxy, within the framework of Ecoacoustics.


## Indices

    * Acoustic Complexity Index
    * Acoustic Diversity Index
    * Acoustic Evenness Index
    * Bioacoustic Index
    * Normalized Difference Sound Index
    * Spectral Entropy
    * Temporal Entropy
    * Number of Peaks
    * Wave Signal to Noise Ratio

* Spectral features extraction
    * Spectral centroid
    * Spectrogram
    * Noise removed spectrogram

* Temporal features extraction
    * RMS energy
    * Zero Crossing Rate

## Usage

Test that everything is going well on one audio file:

``` 
$python main\_test\_indices.py 
```

Compute indices from a directory of audio files:
```
$python  main\_compute\_indices\_from\_dir
```

This is the pipeline of the processing:

* Get list of indices and features from a Yaml configuration file 
* Read WAV files (using scipy)
* For each audio file, compute stats (min, max, mean, median, std, var) for temporal acoustic indices or get global value for other indices
* Output a csv file (with a row for each audio file and a column for each index)

## Prerequisites

 * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 * [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
 * [Matlplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) (for graphing)
 * [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation) (to read configuration file)





## History

Versions:

* 0.5: New main (main\_compute\_indices\_from\_dir) to compute all indices from a directory of audio files
* 0.4: Port from Python 2 to Python 3
* 0.3: New features: wave SNR, spectro noise removed, NB_peaks.
* 0.2: yaml configuration file. Object oriented audio file and index.
* 0.1: First commit
